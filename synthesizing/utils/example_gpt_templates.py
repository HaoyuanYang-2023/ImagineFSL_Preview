These factors are crucial not only for generating images representative of various categories but also for ensuring the synthesized images reflect common photographic practices in everyday life. 

For the {}, you will be provided with a specific form for the three synthesizing factors: {},  {} and {}. By integrating them, you will generate a caption of less than 36 words. Use concise, clear and straightforward language, avoiding extravagant embellishments and vague expressions.
